                various metadata and can cause issues if segmentation changes
                during the round-trip, for example the list could be re-segmented
                to <source>A B C</source> without breaking any constraints or PRs,
                unless canResegment is set to "no", which however should be set on 
                <segment> rather than <unit> or higher structural element.
