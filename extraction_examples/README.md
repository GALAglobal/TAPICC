Extraction (and merging) best practices
===

Repository of different approaches for extracting localizable content from native format into XLIFF2.

New samples and feedback on existing ones via [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) or via [commit comments](https://github.com/blog/42-commit-comments) is welcomed.

To work with these samples it's recommended to use XML aware editor with [NVDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace-based_Validation_Dispatching_Language) support. That way the [Native XLIFF Validation Artifacts](http://docs.oasis-open.org/xliff/xliff-core/v2.1/os/schemas/) can be used.
