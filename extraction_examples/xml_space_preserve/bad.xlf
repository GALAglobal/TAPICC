                and have negative impact on TM leveraging (recycling). For that reason it would make sense
                to let MODIFIER agents to normalize spaces, tabs and blank lines, to improve localizability.
                Also the white-spaces between structural XLIFF nodes are not significant and should be possible
                to normalize them.
